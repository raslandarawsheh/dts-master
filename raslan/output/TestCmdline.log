Demo example of command line interface in RTE

This is a readline-like interface that can be used to
debug your RTE application. It supports some features
of GNU readline like completion, cut/paste, and some
other special bindings.

This demo shows how rte_cmdline library can be
extended to handle a list of objects. There are
3 commands:
- add obj_name IP
- del obj_name
- show obj_name

Demo example of command line interface in RTE

This is a readline-like interface that can be used to
debug your RTE application. It supports some features
of GNU readline like completion, cut/paste, and some
other special bindings.

This demo shows how rte_cmdline library can be
extended to handle a list of objects. There are
3 commands:
- add obj_name IP
- del obj_name
- show obj_name

Demo example of command line interface in RTE

This is a readline-like interface that can be used to
debug your RTE application. It supports some features
of GNU readline like completion, cut/paste, and some
other special bindings.

This demo shows how rte_cmdline library can be
extended to handle a list of objects. There are
3 commands:
- add obj_name IP
- del obj_name
- show obj_name
